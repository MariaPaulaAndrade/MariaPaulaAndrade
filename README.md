# Hi, Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
## About me
My name is Maria Paula. I hold a bachelor's degree in Economics and am currently pursuing a Master's in the same field at the Federal University of Pernambuco. I am passionate about data science and causal inference. 

Currently, I'm sharpening my analytical skills by taking online courses and building up projects that involve data collection, analysis and machine learning using Python and SQL.

During my undergraduate studies, I served as a teaching assistant for Linear Algebra, Macroeconomics as well as Topics on Calculus 1, 2, and 4 which includes topics such as optimization, mathematical modeling, differential and difference equations.

Since 2022, I've been studying and applying advanced statistical modeling techniques, focusing on causal inference and machine learning with Python.

My professional goal is to merge my academic curiosity and analytical mindset with advanced statistical modeling techniques to generate insights that can guide decision-making and tackle complex real-world problems. 

Feel free to reach me out!
